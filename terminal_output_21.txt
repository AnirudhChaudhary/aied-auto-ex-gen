[USER]:  
Implement differences, a generator function that takes t, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the differences between each pair of adjacent values from t. If t iterates over a positive finite number of values n, then differences should yield n-1 times.

Question Concepts:  This problem is testing the following concepts:\n\n1. **Generators and Iterators**: Understanding how to create and use generator functions to yield values one at a time, and how to iterate over an iterator.\n\n2. **Control Flow**: Using loops to iterate through elements and calculate differences between consecutive elements.\n\n3. **Sequence Processing**: Handling sequences of data, specifically focusing on adjacent elements within a sequence.\n\n4. **Function Implementation**: Writing a function that adheres to a specified behavior and output format.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Considering scenarios like iterators with a single element or handling the end of an iterator properly.'

Tweaked Problem:  Implement cumulative_sums, a generator function that takes s, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the cumulative sums of the values from s.

[SYSTEM]:  You are an expert verifier. You will be given an incomplete problem and you will generate a few test cases that test the functionality of the program. An example is: >>> list(differences(iter([5, 2, -100, 103])))
    [-3, -102, 203]
    >>> next(differences(iter([39, 100])))
