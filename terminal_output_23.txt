Feedback:  Yes, the question tests the specified concepts. \n\n1. **Generators and Iterators**: The question requires implementing a generator function (`differences`) that takes an iterator (`t`) and yields computed values (differences), demonstrating an understanding of generators and iterators.\n\n2. **Iteration and Looping**: The function needs to iterate over the elements of the iterator `t` to compute differences, which involves using loops.\n\n3. **Sequence Manipulation**: The task is to calculate differences between consecutive elements in the sequence, which directly tests sequence manipulation.\n\n4. **Yield Statement**: The function must use the `yield` statement to produce a series of values (differences), testing the understanding of how to use `yield`.\n\n5. **Handling Non-Empty Iterators**: The problem statement specifies that `t` is a non-empty iterator, and the function should correctly handle this assumption.\n\nThe question is well-aligned with the concepts it is intended to test.'
