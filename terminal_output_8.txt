Implement differences, a generator function that takes t, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the differences between each pair of adjacent values from t. If t iterates over a positive finite number of values n, then differences should yield n-1 times.

Question Concepts:  This problem is testing the following concepts:\n\n1. **Generators and Iterators**: Understanding how to create a generator function that can iterate over an input iterator and yield values one at a time.\n\n2. **Iteration and Looping**: Using loops to traverse through an iterator and access elements in sequence.\n\n3. **Difference Calculation**: Calculating the difference between consecutive elements in a sequence.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensuring the function works correctly with the minimum number of elements (e.g., when the iterator has only one element).\n\n5. **Yield Statement**: Using the `yield` statement to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them all at once and sending them back.'

Tweaked Problem:  Implement cumulative_sum, a generator function that takes s, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the cumulative sum of the values from s. If s iterates over a positive finite number of values n, then cumulative_sum should yield n times.\n\n```python\ndef cumulative_sum(s):\n    \'\'\'Yield the cumulative sum of values from iterator s.\n\n    >>> list(cumulative_sum(iter([1, 2, 3, 4])))\n    [1, 3, 6, 10]\n    >>> next(cumulative_sum(iter([10, 20, 30])))\n    10\n    \'\'\'\n    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"\n```'

Feedback:  Yes, the question tests the specified concepts. Here's how:\n\n1. **Generators and Iterators**: The question asks to implement a generator function `differences` that takes an iterator `t` and yields values, which directly involves creating and using a generator.\n\n2. **Iteration and Looping**: The task involves iterating over the input iterator `t` to access elements in sequence, which requires using loops.\n\n3. **Difference Calculation**: The function is required to calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the sequence, which is explicitly stated in the task.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The question specifies that `t` is a non-empty iterator, implying that the function should handle the minimum number of elements (e.g., when the iterator has only one element) correctly.\n\n5. **Yield Statement**: The function must use the `yield` statement to produce the differences between adjacent values over time, rather than computing them all at once.\n\nThe question provides a clear description and examples that align with testing these concepts."
