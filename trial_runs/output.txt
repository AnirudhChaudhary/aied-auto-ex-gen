response is a string? :  **Practice Problem:**

Implement a function `create_multiplier(n)` that returns a function. This returned function should take a single argument and return its product with `n`. Utilize nested function definitions and lexical scoping to achieve this. 

1. Define the outer function `create_multiplier`.
2. Inside this function, define an inner function that performs the multiplication.
3. Ensure that the inner function accesses the variable `n` from the outer function through lexical scoping.
4. Test your implementation with an example that demonstrates the closure property.

```python
def create_multiplier(n):
    """
    Returns a function that takes a single argument and returns its product with n.
    """

    def multiplier(x):
        # YOUR SOLUTION HERE
        pass

    return multiplier

# Example usage:
double = create_multiplier(2)
print(double(5))  # Output should be 10

triple = create_multiplier(3)
print(triple(5))  # Output should be 15
```

**Important Concepts to Consider:**

- Explain how this implementation uses higher-order functions by returning a function from `create_multiplier`.
- Discuss how lexical scoping is utilized to allow the inner function `multiplier` to access the `n` from its enclosing function.
- Highlight the concept of closures and how they allow the returned function to "remember" the value of `n` even after `create_multiplier` has finished executing.

response is a string? :  **Practice Problem:**

Design a function `power_function_creator(exponent)` that generates and returns another function. The returned function should compute the power of a given base raised to the specified `exponent`. Use nested function definitions, lexical scoping, and closures to achieve this. 

**Steps to Implement:**

1. Define the outer function `power_function_creator` that takes a single parameter `exponent`.
2. Within `power_function_creator`, define a nested function that computes the base raised to the power of the `exponent`.
3. Allow the nested function to access the `exponent` variable via lexical scoping.
4. Demonstrate the concept of closures by showing the returned function retains access to `exponent` after `power_function_creator` has exited.
5. Test your implementation with examples to verify its correctness.

```python
def power_function_creator(exponent):
    """
    Returns a function that raises its argument to the power of `exponent`.
    """
    def power(base):
        # Compute base to the power of exponent
        return base ** exponent
    
    return power

# Example usage:
square = power_function_creator(2)
print(square(5))  # Output should be 25

cube = power_function_creator(3)
print(cube(5))    # Output should be 125
```

**Concepts to Consider:**

- **Higher-order Functions:** The function `power_function_creator` illustrates a higher-order function since it returns another function, thereby increasing expressiveness.
  
- **Lexical Scoping:** The nested function `power` uses lexical scoping to access the `exponent` defined in its enclosing scope (`power_function_creator`), enabling it to compute powers correctly.

- **Closures:** The returned `power` function is a closure because it captures the environment in which it was defined, particularly the `exponent` variable, allowing it to retain this binding even after `power_function_creator` has finished executing. This showcases how functions can "remember" the context they were created in, providing them with operational continuity.
