Question Concepts:  This problem is testing the following concepts:\n\n1. **Generators**: Understanding how to implement and use generator functions in Python to yield values one at a time.\n\n2. **Iterators**: Working with iterators to traverse through a sequence of elements.\n\n3. **Looping through sequences**: Using loops to iterate over elements in a sequence and perform operations on them.\n\n4. **Arithmetic operations**: Performing subtraction to calculate differences between adjacent elements in a sequence.\n\n5. **Edge cases**: Handling cases where the iterator has a minimal number of elements (e.g., only one element).\n\n6. **Lazy evaluation**: Understanding how generators provide values on-the-fly without storing the entire sequence in memory.'

Feedback:  Yes, the question tests the specified concepts. Here's how:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question asks to implement a generator function `differences`, which inherently involves using the `yield` statement to produce values one at a time.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The function `differences` takes an iterator `t` as input, requiring the understanding of how to work with iterators in Python.\n\n3. **Looping through sequences**: The task involves iterating over the elements of the iterator `t` to compute differences between adjacent elements, which requires using loops.\n\n4. **Arithmetic operations**: The question specifically asks to yield the differences between adjacent values, which involves performing subtraction.\n\n5. **Edge cases**: The problem mentions that `t` is a non-empty iterator, implying that the function should handle cases where the iterator has a minimal number of elements (e.g., only one element).\n\n6. **Lazy evaluation**: By implementing a generator, the function will yield differences on-the-fly, demonstrating an understanding of lazy evaluation as it doesn't store the entire sequence in memory.\n\nThe question effectively covers all the required concepts."
