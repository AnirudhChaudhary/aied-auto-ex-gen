Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts.

The question should specify how to handle such cases or test the implementation with such scenarios."

Question: Implement `cumulative_sums`, a generator function that takes `s`, a non-empty iterable over numbers. It yields the cumulative sum of values from `s`.

It handles iterables with a single element by yielding the cumulative sum, which in this case is just the element itself."

Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts. Here's what's missing:\n\n1. **Generators in Python**: The question does involve creating a generator function using the `yield` statement, which is correctly addressed.\n\n2. **Iterators and Iterables**: The question specifies that `t` is a non-empty iterator, which is correct. However, it does not explicitly require the candidate to convert an iterable into an iterator using `iter()`, which is an important part of understanding iterators and iterables.\n\n3. **Looping Constructs**: The question requires looping over elements in an iterator, which is correctly addressed.\n\n4. **Sequence Manipulation**: The question requires calculating differences between consecutive elements, which is correctly addressed.\n\n5. **Edge Cases Handling**: The question assumes `t` is a non-empty iterator, but it does not explicitly ask the candidate to handle edge cases where the iterator might have only one element. Although the problem states it will be non-empty, handling a single-element iterator is still an important edge case to consider."
