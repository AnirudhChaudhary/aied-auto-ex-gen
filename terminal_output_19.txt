Implement differences, a generator function that takes t, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the differences between each pair of adjacent values from t. If t iterates over a positive finite number of values n, then differences should yield n-1 times.

Question Concepts:  This problem is testing the following concepts:\n\n1. **Generators**: Understanding how to create and use generator functions in Python, which yield values one at a time and maintain state between calls.\n\n2. **Iterators**: Working with iterators to traverse through a sequence of elements.\n\n3. **Looping and Iteration**: Using loops to iterate over elements in an iterator and compute differences between consecutive elements.\n\n4. **Yield Statement**: Using the `yield` statement to produce a series of values from a function, allowing it to be paused and resumed.\n\n5. **Sequence Processing**: Understanding how to process sequences of numbers to compute derived values (differences in this case).\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: Handling cases where the iterator has only one element or is empty, though the problem specifies a non-empty iterator.'

Tweaked Problem:  Create a generator function called `ratios` that takes an iterator `s`, which is a non-empty iterator over numbers. This function should yield the ratios between each pair of adjacent values from `s`. If `s` iterates over a positive finite number of values `m`, then `ratios` should yield `m-1` times.\n\n```python\ndef ratios(s):\n    \'\'\'Yield the ratios between adjacent values from iterator s.\n\n    >>> list(ratios(iter([10, 5, 1])))\n    [2.0, 5.0]\n    >>> next(ratios(iter([50, 25, 5])))\n    2.0\n    \'\'\'\n    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"\n```'

Feedback:  Yes, the question tests the specified concepts. \n\n- **Generators**: The task requires creating a generator function (`differences`) that yields values.\n- **Iterators**: The function takes an iterator `t` as input and processes it.\n- **Looping and Iteration**: The function needs to iterate over the elements of the iterator `t` to compute differences between consecutive elements.\n- **Yield Statement**: The function should use the `yield` statement to produce the differences.\n- **Sequence Processing**: The function processes a sequence of numbers to compute differences between adjacent values.\n- **Edge Cases**: The problem specifies that the iterator is non-empty, so handling of edge cases like an empty iterator is not required, but the function should correctly handle iterators with only one element by not yielding any values.\n\nThe question aligns well with the concepts provided.'

[SYSTEM]:  You are an expert verifier. You will be given an incomplete problem and you will generate a few test cases that test the functionality of the program. An example is: >>> list(differences(iter([5, 2, -100, 103])))
    [-3, -102, 203]
    >>> next(differences(iter([39, 100])))
