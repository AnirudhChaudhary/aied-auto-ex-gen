Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts. Here's what is missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question does test the concept of generators by asking for the implementation of generator functions `cumulative_sum` and `differences`.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question involves iterators by requiring the functions to take an iterator as input, but it does not explicitly test the understanding of how to work with iterators beyond passing them to the generator functions.\n\n3. **Looping and Iteration**: The question implies the need for looping to process elements from the iterator, but it does not explicitly test the understanding of using loops within the generator functions.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations**: The question does not test arithmetic operations directly. The `cumulative_sum` function involves addition, while the `differences` function involves subtraction, but the question does not explicitly require the implementation of these arithmetic operations.\n\n5. **Function Implementation**: The question does test the ability to implement functions with specified behavior and output format, but it does not provide detailed requirements for edge cases or error handling, which are often part of function implementation.\n\nOverall, the question could be improved by explicitly requiring the implementation of arithmetic operations and providing more detailed instructions on handling iterators and loops within the generator functions."

Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts. Here's what is missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question does require implementing a generator function, which is appropriate.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question involves working with iterators, as it specifies that the input `t` is an iterator. This concept is tested.\n\n3. **Looping and Iteration**: The question implies the need for looping to process elements from the iterator `t`, which is relevant.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations**: The question requires calculating differences between adjacent numbers, which involves subtraction. This concept is tested.\n\n5. **Function Implementation**: The question asks for the implementation of a function with a specific behavior, which is relevant.\n\nHowever, the question does not provide a complete implementation or a clear prompt for the user to fill in the missing code in the `differences` function. It only includes a placeholder `*** YOUR CODE HERE ***`, which does not guide the user on how to implement the function. To fully test the concepts, the question should explicitly instruct the user to implement the function and ensure that it adheres to the specified behavior and output format."
