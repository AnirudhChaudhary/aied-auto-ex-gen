Tweaked Problem:  Create a generator function named `ratios` that takes `s`, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the ratios between each pair of adjacent values from `s`.

Feedback:  No, the question does not test all the specified concepts. Here's what's missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question does involve creating a generator function using the `yield` statement, which is correctly aligned with the concept.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question requires working with iterators, which is also covered as the function takes an iterator as input and uses `next()` to retrieve elements.\n\n3. **Looping and Control Flow**: The question implies using a loop to iterate through elements of an iterator, which is consistent with the concept.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations**: The question asks for calculating differences between adjacent numbers, which involves subtraction, aligning with the concept.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The question specifies that the iterator is non-empty, but it does not explicitly address handling cases where the iterator has only one element. While the problem statement mentions that the iterator is non-empty, it should also clarify how to handle the case when there is only one element, as the generator should not yield any values in that scenario."

Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts. Here's what's missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question does require the creation of a generator function, which is correct. However, the provided code snippet for `ratios` is not directly related to the task of implementing `differences`. The question should explicitly ask to implement the generator function `differences` using the `yield` statement.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question involves working with iterators, which is correct. However, it should explicitly mention using the `next()` function to retrieve the first element from the iterator, as demonstrated in the `ratios` example.\n\n3. **Looping and Control Flow**: The question involves using loops to iterate through elements of an iterator, which is correct. However, it should explicitly mention calculating differences between consecutive elements, as the focus is on differences rather than ratios.\n\n4. **Arithmetic Operations**: The question involves performing subtraction to calculate differences, which is correct. However, it should explicitly mention this operation in the context of the `differences` function.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The question should explicitly mention handling cases where the iterator has only one element by not yielding any values, as demonstrated in the `ratios` example. This ensures that the edge case is considered in the implementation of `differences`.\n\nOverall, the question should be revised to focus on implementing the `differences` generator function with clear instructions on using the `yield` statement, handling iterators, and considering edge cases."
