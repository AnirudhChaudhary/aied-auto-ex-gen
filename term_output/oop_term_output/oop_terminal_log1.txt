These classes should modify the behavior of their parent class to meet specific display outputs based on doctests.\n\nLet's verify the provided solution by examining if it satisfies the requirements:\n\n1. **Class `QuestionMark`:**\n   - Inherits from the `Pattern` class.\n   - Initializes with `self.sep = '?'`.\n   - Overrides `next_symbol()` to return a `Symbol` object with the character `'?'`.\n\n   This makes the `display()` method output from `Pattern` class:\n\n   ```python\n   def display(self):\n       first, last = self.next_symbol(), self.next_symbol()\n       print('! ' + first.show() + self.sep + last.show() + '!')\n   ```\n\n   Specific to `QuestionMark`, the `display` method becomes:\n\n   ```python\n   first, last = Symbol('?'), Symbol('?')\n   print('! ' + '?' + '?' + '?' + '!')\n   ```\n\n   This outputs `? ???` as required by the doctest.\n\n2. **Class `ExclamationMark`:**\n   - Also inherits from the `Pattern` class.\n   - Initializes with `self.sep = '!'`.\n   - Overrides `next_symbol()` to alternate between a `Symbol('?')` and `Symbol('!')`.\n\n   The provided `next_symbol()` function attempts to use a logical check on a private attribute, `_first`, to determine which symbol to return. However, this code contains a flaw since it does not properly track the sequence of symbols, resulting in incorrect implementations of stateful logic for alternating symbols. There isn't any mechanism to achieve alternating symbols as described with just this code, and without modification, the `ExclamationMark` would not pass the doctest.\n\nFrom the problem's point of view, the provided solutions need adjustment since the `ExclamationMark` implementation won't necessarily lead to `? !?` display output. The design calls for state tracking between calls to `next_symbol()` which is not handled correctly here.\n\nTo correctly implement the `ExclamationMark` class, one would need to incorporate state monitoring such as a counter or toggle to switch between '?' and '!' consistently. Otherwise, steps might miss the required alternating formatting. However, this was not correctly done per the provided solution code.\n\nIn conclusion, the `QuestionMark` implementation meets specifications, but the `ExclamationMark` class needs work due to state-handling errors in the `next_symbol()` method.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1731361144, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=520, prompt_tokens=522, total_tokens=1042, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, accepted_prediction_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))
