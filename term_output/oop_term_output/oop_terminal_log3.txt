This is appropriate because the `Sound` class already implements a mechanism to make the sound loud when `loud` is set to `True`.\n   - **Doctest Verification:** The doctest `LoudDuck().quack() should print `[QUACK]`, which is satisfied because the overridden `next_sound` method returns a `Sound(True)`, leading to the string `'QUACK'`, which is then printed as `[QUACK]` by the `quack` method of `Duck`.\n\n2. **QuietDuck Class Implementation:**\n\n   - **Customization:** A nested `SilenceSound` class is defined in the `next_sound` method, which has a `make` method returning the string `'silence'`.\n   - **Inheritance:** The `QuietDuck` class inherits from `Duck`, but it does not need further attributes in its constructor apart from setting the `edge`, which aligns with the base class `Duck`. \n   - **Doctest Verification:** The doctest `QuietDuck().quack()` should print `[silence]`, which is satisfied because `next_sound` now returns an instance of `SilenceSound`. This instance's `make` method returns `'silence'`, resulting in `[silence]` being printed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe solution provided effectively and correctly implements the `LoudDuck` and `QuietDuck` classes by extending the `Duck` class and only customizing the necessary behavior in the `next_sound` method. It reuses the `Sound` class where possible and introduces minimal new code to achieve the required behaviors. Both classes satisfy their respective doctests.\n\nHence, the solution provided is correct.", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1731361236, model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_45cf54deae', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=450, prompt_tokens=513, total_tokens=963, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, accepted_prediction_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0)))
