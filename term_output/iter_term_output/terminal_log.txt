This prevents index shifts that occur in a list when items are removed.\n     - For `indices = [3, 0, 2]`, this would result in `[3, 2, 0]`.\n\n   - **List Comprehension `[cards.pop(j) for j in sorted(indices, reverse=True)]`:**\n     - This list comprehension iterates over the sorted indices and removes the elements from `cards` at each respective index using the `pop` method, which removes and returns the item at the specified index.\n     - For each `j` in `[3, 2, 0]`, `cards.pop(j)` is called, removing the elements `5`, `'B'`, and `8` respectively.\n     - After this operation, `cards` will be modified to `['A', 3, 'D']`.\n\n   - **`reversed(...)` and `list(...)`:**\n     - `reversed(...)` is used to reverse the list of removed elements to ensure they are in the order specified by the original indices list, i.e., `[8, 'B', 5]`, corresponding to the order in `indices = [3, 0, 2]`.\n     - `list(...)` converts the reversed iterator back into a list.\n\n3. **Final Result:**\n   - The function correctly returns the list `[8, 'B', 5]` and modifies `cards` to `['A', 3, 'D']`, which matches the expected behavior and examples provided in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the provided solution is correct.
