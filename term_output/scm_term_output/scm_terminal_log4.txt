The function `group-three` should take a list `t` and split it into sublists of 3 elements each, except possibly the last sublist which can have between 1 and 3 elements.\n\n### Analysis of the Solution:\n\n1. **Main Function: `group-three`:**\n   - It checks if the list `t` is empty using `(null? t)`.\n   - If `t` is empty, it returns an empty list `'()`.\n   - Otherwise, it uses `(cons (take t 3) (group-three (drop t 3)))`:\n     - `take t 3`: Extracts the first 3 elements from `t`.\n     - `group-three (drop t 3)`: Recursively processes the remainder of the list after the first 3 elements are removed.\n\n2. **Helper Function: `take`:**\n   - Takes the first `n` elements from `lst`.\n   - When `n` is 0 or `lst` is empty, it returns an empty list.\n   - Otherwise, it constructs a new list by taking the first element of `lst` and recursively calling `take` on the rest of `lst` with `n` decremented by 1.\n\n3. **Helper Function: `drop`:**\n   - Drops the first `n` elements from `lst`.\n   - When `n` is 0 or `lst` is empty, it returns `lst` itself (as `drop` finished its job).\n   - Otherwise, it recursively calls `drop` on the rest of `lst` with `n` decremented by 1 until `n` reaches 0.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- The first test case is `(group-three '(7 8 9 10 11 12))`:\n  - `group-three` splits the list into `((7 8 9) (10 11 12))`, as `(take '(7 8 9 10 11 12) 3)` gives `(7 8 9)` and `(drop '(7 8 9 10 11 12) 3)` gives `(10 11 12)`, which is processed similarly.\n\n- The second test case is `(group-three '(7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14))`:\n  - It results in `((7 8 9) (10 11 12) (13 14))`:\n    - First call: `(take '(7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14) 3)` gives `(7 8 9)` and `(drop '(7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14) 3)` gives `(10 11 12 13 14)`.\n    - Second call: `(take '(10 11 12 13 14) 3)` gives `(10 11 12)` and `(drop '(10 11 12 13 14) 3)` gives `(13 14)`.\n    - Third call: `(take '(13 14) 3)` gives `(13 14)`, and dropping the remaining elements would be unnecessary since it will return an empty list.\n\nThe solution adheres to the problem requirements and passes the provided test cases.
