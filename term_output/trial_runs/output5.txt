[SYSTEM]:  You are a teacher, teaching a course on Python.
[USER]:  Generate a practice problem from the following summary: Higher-order functions: Passing functions as arguments enhances expressiveness but can clutter the global frame with many unique function names and requires specific argument signatures.

Nested function definitions: Defining functions within other functions addresses issues with name collisions and argument compatibility, as these local functions are only accessible during the enclosing function's execution. Local definitions are evaluated only when the enclosing function is called.

Lexical scoping:

Inner functions can access names defined in their enclosing scope.
Functions share the enclosing environment's names rather than the calling environmentâ€™s.
Environment model extensions:

User-defined functions now include a "parent environment" annotation, indicating where they were defined.
Nested function calls create extended environments with chains of frames that can be arbitrarily long, ending at the global frame.
Frame resolution: When evaluating a nested function, Python resolves variable names by searching through the chain of frames, starting from the current frame and moving up to the parent frames.

Advantages of lexical scoping:

Local function names do not interfere with external names.
Inner functions can access variables from the enclosing environment.
Closures: Functions defined within other functions retain access to the data from their defining environment, effectively "enclosing" this data.. The problem should be standalone, allowing me to directly input it into a test. Attached are also some examples of problems that have been used in this section. Please consider the structure of these problems, but do not copy them exactly! def curried_pow(x):
        def h(y):

[SYSTEM]:  You are an expert solver. You look at the questions, think about the correct solution, and return only the solution to the questions without the explanations.
[USER]:  Answer the following questions: ### Practice Problem: Understanding Higher-Order Functions and Lexical Scoping

**Problem Statement:**

Consider the following Python code implementing a higher-order function using nested function definitions and lexical scoping:

```python
def create_multiplier(factor):
    def multiplier(number):
        return number * factor
    return multiplier

# Part A
double = create_multiplier(2)
triple = create_multiplier(3)

# Part B
result1 = double(5)
result2 = triple(4)
```

**Questions:**

1. What are the outputs of `result1` and `result2`? Explain how they are computed using the concepts of higher-order functions and lexical scoping.
2. Describe how Python's environment model handles the nested function calls in this problem. Specifically, explain how variable names are resolved.
3. If a new function `quadruple` is created with `quadruple = create_multiplier(4)`, what is the output of `quadruple(6)`? Explain your reasoning.

**Answer Key:**

1. 
   - `result1` is `10`, because `double` is a multiplier function with a `factor` of `2`. Therefore, `double(5)` multiplies `5` by `2`.
   - `result2` is `12`, because `triple` is a multiplier function with a `factor` of `3`. Therefore, `triple(4)` multiplies `4` by `3`.

2.
   - When `create_multiplier` is called, it creates a nested `multiplier` function. The `factor` is captured by the nested function due to lexical scoping, allowing `multiplier` to access `factor` from its enclosing environment even after `create_multiplier` has finished execution.
   - Python resolves variable names by first looking in the current local scope (inside `multiplier`) and then moving up to its enclosing scope (inside `create_multiplier`), allowing `multiplier` to use `factor`.

3. 
   - The output of `quadruple(6)` is `24`. This is because `quadruple` is a multiplier function with a `factor` of `4`. When called with `6`, it multiplies `6` by `4`, as the `factor` is captured in the closure's environment.
Generated Solution:  1. `result1` is `10`. `result2` is `12`.
2. 
3. The output of `quadruple(6)` is `24`.
