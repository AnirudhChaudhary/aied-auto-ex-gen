Tweaked Problem:  Create a generator function called `ratios` that takes `s`, a non-empty iterator over numbers. It yields the ratios between each pair of adjacent values from `s`. If `s` iterates over a positive finite number of values `m`, then `ratios` should yield `m-1` times.\n\n```python\ndef ratios(s):\n    \'\'\'Yield the ratios between adjacent values from iterator s.\n\n    >>> list(ratios(iter([10, 5, 20, 4])))\n    [0.5, 4.0, 0.2]\n    >>> next(ratios(iter([50, 25])))\n    0.5\n    \'\'\'\n    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"\n```'

Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the intended concepts. Here's what's missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question does require implementing a generator function, which is correct.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question involves working with iterators, but it does not explicitly require managing the state of the iterator beyond basic iteration. It should test understanding of how to handle the iterator's state more explicitly.\n\n3. **Looping Constructs**: The question involves using loops to iterate over elements, which is correct.\n\n4. **Sequence Manipulation**: The question asks for calculating differences between adjacent elements, which is correct.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The question does not explicitly mention handling edge cases, such as when the iterator has only one element. This should be included to ensure that the function can handle minimal input sizes gracefully."

Feedback:  No, the question does not fully test all the specified concepts. Here's what's missing:\n\n1. **Generators**: The question asks to implement a generator function, which is addressed by the task of implementing the `differences` function using `yield`. This concept is covered.\n\n2. **Iterators**: The question involves working with iterators by taking `t` as an input, which is an iterator. However, the question does not explicitly test understanding of managing the iterator's state beyond basic usage.\n\n3. **Looping Constructs**: The question requires using a loop to iterate over elements in the iterator `t`, which is covered by the task.\n\n4. **Sequence Manipulation**: The question requires calculating differences between adjacent elements in a sequence, which is covered.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The question does not explicitly address handling edge cases where the iterator has a minimal number of elements (e.g., only one element). The provided example assumes `t` is non-empty but does not specify behavior for cases with only one element, which is crucial for robust implementation. \n\nTo fully test the concepts, the question should include a test case or explanation about handling an iterator with a single element, ensuring the function correctly yields nothing in such cases."
